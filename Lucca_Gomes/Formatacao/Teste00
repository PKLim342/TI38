Ezekiel [25:17]
The path of the righteous man is based on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyrrany of evil man.
Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness.
For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
And I will srike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to posion and destroy my brothers.
And you will know my name is the lord when I lay my vangeance upon thee...
